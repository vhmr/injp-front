      `<div>As an undergraduate student in one of the universities in Indonesia, we are mostly obligated to participate in a community empowerment program, where we are supposed to help the locals by applying our knowledge. Usually, we have to physically be in the community area to take part in this program, but because of the covid pandemic, the program was held online.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>There were several problems that can be solved, so we divided the tasks among multiple people. My team got a task to help the locals to promote their products and villas online. This problem is fascinating to be solved because they had tried to publish their products and villas on mainstream e-commerce platforms, but itâ€™s not easy to comply with all the rules. So there are only a few products that can be promoted on those platforms. After several discussions with the locals and my team, we decided to launch and manage our own website to promote everything about this place.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>Then, we planned everything that we want to display on the website. We want to promote four types of items on the website: local crafts (sculpture, batik, wood crafts, etc.), villas, regional destinations, and vacation packages. We also experimented on the landing pageâ€™s design so that it can be attractive and appealing to potential tourists. Additionally, we added a route guide on how to get to the place by any kind of public transports (bus, angkot, motorcycle, commuter rail, etc.). The guide includes the schedule for each public transportation and the fares.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>Initially, we planned to host all the data that needs to be displayed on the website in a relational database (PostgreSQL) and manage the contents through a simple CMS like WordPress or a more modern CMS like Strapi. Since we have to rent a server to host those CMS, we decided to research on the alternatives that can be used for free and without the need to rent a server. After thorough exploration, we found out about git-based CMS, a CMS that utilizes a git server to store all the content information. There are several services that offer a git-based CMS system, but we chose Forestry because we think it has good UI/UX, and itâ€™s more mature than the alternatives. Forestry stores all of the content in a Github repo, so we can have a fully working CMS for free.</div>

      <div>After that, we have to decide what technology we will use for the frontend. Itâ€™s really exciting for me to do a small project like this because I can try and validate new cutting-edge technology. Some months before, I discovered a cool talk about web reactivity by Rich Harris, the creator of the Svelte framework (Rethinking Reactivity). Well, itâ€™s more of a language than a framework, Rich Harris clarifies more on that here. What makes it different than the other UI framework like React or Vue is that Svelte shifts the work of the runtime in the browser into a compile step that happens when you build your app. So, Svelte apps can come with drastically smaller bundle sizes than the others because there is no overhead for the framework runtime.</div>`,
